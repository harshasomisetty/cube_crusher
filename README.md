# Integrating GameShift with Unity

This document provides guidelines on integrating GameShift, into your Unity game to handle transactions and game state securely and efficiently.

## Recommended Game Architecture

When integrating GameShift into your Unity game, we recommend the following architecture:

- **Game Client:** A Unity application that the player interacts with. It is responsible for presenting the game state and handling user inputs.
- **Server:** Your custom backend server acts as an intermediary between the Game Client and GameShift API. It is crucial for several reasons:
  - *Security:* The server ensures that sensitive GameShift API calls are not exposed to the client, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and manipulation.
  - *User Profiling:* Stores persistent user data that lives with the game, such as profiles, progress, and statistics.
  - *Custom Game Logic:* Allows the implementation of custom game logic that is not handled by the Game Client or GameShift API. Utilizing a server will make this data processing faster than in Unity.
 - **GameShift:** Gameshift will contain the canonical on-chain data for your game

The server plays a major role in this architecture by processing game logic, securely interacting with the GameShift API, and updating the game state based on the responses.

## Setup

Once you setup the server environment variables, you need to setup appropriate templates to represent game user profiles & character configs. From the server folder, run

```
sh ./scripts/template_setup.sh
```

This should setup the templates in your Gameshift Game. You can now copy the template IDs from the Gameshift template collectible browser as env variables to your server.


## Workflow

The interaction between the Game Client, Server, and GameShift API typically follows these steps. We've included sample code to demonstrate a potential integrationâ€”the github repo is available [here](https://github.com/harshasomisetty/cube_crusher/tree/main), we will follow sample code to show how a player might be awarded an nft after clearing a level

1. **Action Sending:** The Game Client sends player actions to the Server. [code](https://github.com/harshasomisetty/cube_crusher/blob/438d3047d4b86a3a4c5ec958b642a0490cbef2c4/3dgame/Assets/Scripts/Data/NetworkService.cs#L49)


```
    public IEnumerator AwardUser(string userEmail, Action<string> onSuccess, Action<string> onError)
        {
            string url = AppConfig.SERVER_ENDPOINT + "/user/" + userEmail + "/award";

            using (UnityWebRequest webRequest = new UnityWebRequest(url, "POST"))
            {
                webRequest.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();
                webRequest.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(new byte[0]);
                webRequest.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

                yield return webRequest.SendWebRequest();

                if (webRequest.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.ConnectionError || webRequest.result == UnityWebRequest.Result.ProtocolError)
                {
                    onError?.Invoke(webRequest.error);
                }
                else
                {
                    onSuccess?.Invoke(webRequest.downloadHandler.text);
                }
            }
        }
```


2. **Data Processing:** The Server processes these actions and sends relevant requests to the GameShift API, and receives an appropriate response. [code](https://github.com/harshasomisetty/cube_crusher/blob/438d3047d4b86a3a4c5ec958b642a0490cbef2c4/server/src/routes/user.ts#L156)


```
    router.post('/:email/award', async (req, res) => {
      const email = req.params.email;
      const refId = email.split('@')[0];
    
      try {
        const result = await awardToUser(refId);
        res.json({
          ...result,
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in /award route:', error.message);
        res.status(error.response?.status || 500).send({ message: error.message });
      }
    });
```

3. **State Update:** The Server updates the game state and sends it back to the Game Client. [code](https://github.com/harshasomisetty/cube_crusher/blob/438d3047d4b86a3a4c5ec958b642a0490cbef2c4/3dgame/Assets/Scripts/Menus/EndMenu.cs#L81)

```
    public void OnAwardUserSuccess(string json)
    {
        var awardData = JsonUtility.FromJson<AwardJson>(json);
        if (awardImage == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("awardImage is not assigned in the inspector.");
            return;
        }
        redeemUI.SetActive(false);
        awardUI.SetActive(true);
        StartCoroutine(networkService.DownloadImage(awardData.imageUrl, awardImage));
    
    
        Debug.Log("User awarded successfully");
    }
```
